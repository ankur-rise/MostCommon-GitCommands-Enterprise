# MostCommon-GitCommands-Enterprise
Here, I am sharing some most commonly used git commands in daily basis development. These commands will give you capability from creating a local branch to change commit history. All the commands, I am mentioning here have been used in my 7 year of experience in IT development. 

Although, I have read many articles to find these commands and I would like to thank all of them to share information for helping developers.
I don't remember all articles but i'll share link of them, whom i remeber.
